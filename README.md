LineRunner2
===========

Is the spiritual successor of my first LineRunner written in 2011.
This game is written in C++ using my custom game engine "BurningByte", which you can also find on GitHub.

## Issues

If you experience any issues with the game window or resolution, you can edit the settings.cfg file.
A default one for 1080p looks like this:

```
wndPosition = {0, 0} // for multi monitor setups
wndSize = {1920, 1080} // window size (width, height)
fullscreen = 1; // 0 = off, 1 = on
jump = "W"; // use normal keys only
roll = "S";
pause = "P";
retry = "R";
```
